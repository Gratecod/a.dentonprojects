        <p>When was the last time you took a vacation?  With all the crisis happening in the world, be it Covid-19, the war on Ukraine, etc, etc, plus life's own personal daily stress, we never fully understand how fast we are going until our bodies lets us know that it's time to slow down.  This is the time when we need to get away from it all and take some personal me time to relax and unwind and recharge our energies</p>
        <p>If you have thought about all the factors mentioned above, then I will simply cut to the chase and tell you about a beautiful and wonderful vacation spot where you can go and recharge and feel refreshed.  I'm talking about the Sandals Resort, located in the tropical island of Jamaica on the western end of the island.  You know, where you find all the beautiful beaches, waterfalls, plus  hunting and rafting adventures, and the list is by no means exhaustive, there's <em>so much more</em> to do and explore.</p>
        <h2>Why the Sandals Resort?</h2>
        
        <p classs="why-the-sandals">If you are asking yourself this question, then that's a good thing because you might be thinking to yourself that you have huge options as far as vacation ideas go...and that may be true!  The thing is we have to learn to get rid of the many whirlwinds that saturates our daily lives and learn to narrow down to the bare essentials.  Then, and only then, we will be able focus and achieve our goals, and vacation goals are just one of the many that we can find a work around solution to.</p>  
        <p classs="why-the-sandals">There's the saying that knowledge brings wisdom, but I would like to rephrase that a bit to read, <strong>"knowledge and experience brings wisdom."</strong>You see, like most people looking, I wanted to find the best vacation spots in the world where I could go to on every year to just get away from it all.  While there are many booking and travelling agencies out there that will "fill you in," so to speak, on the best vacation spots across the world, I thought it would be best to speak to individuals that I have met on a daily basis, and ask them about their experiences travelling to different parts of the world, and that's exactly what I did. </p>
        <h2>People are happy to talk about their experiences and give their honest feedbacks!</h2>

<p>What I have found is that people are usually brutally honest about their vacation experiences, and believe me I've met a lot!  My job as a front desk Reservation Specialist for a large and exclusive hotel chain affords me the opportunity to meet vacationers from all walks of life.  Apart from leaving them with a memorable experience, I would always pique their interest to find out what are the best vaction spots they travelled to across the world.  From this I was able to gather a plethora of information on some of the best vacation spots both locally and internationally, and that is why I have started this blog, to focus on the best vactions spots based on what others have said, doing my own own research, and sharing my own personal experience. Remember the whirlwind I talked about earlier, well, I promise you that after reading this article and acting on the information you receive, I can assure you that your next vacation will be a winner, and you'll have me to thank you for it.  I know, a little cocky but what can i say?  Rest assured that you will be receiving the most recent and updated  information on the planet when you visit our website. </p>

<p>I mentioned the Sandals Resort earlier, and here's <strong><em>a list of 7 reasons</em> </strong> why you should choose this resort as the cr√®me de crop of Jamaican resorts.</p>
<ul>
    <li>200 acres property with tons of amenities</li>
    <li>Large air-conditioned rooms with personal work space</li>
    <li>White sandy beach encompassing the entire property...it's literally a beach front resort</li>
    <li>High level security</li>
    <li>Great tasting exotic island flavored foods...don't forget to try the jerk-chicken</li>
    <li>Horseback riding</li>
    <li>Deep scuba diving</li>
    
    </ul>
    <p id="resort-benefits">I have not even begun to scratch the surface of all that the resort have to offer but, I can tell you, as someone who have visited the resort, I never wanted my time to come to an end.</p>
    <h2>What Does It Cost To Visit The Sandals Resort?</h2>
    <p>No worries, I have your back since I figured that this was a question that you are more than likely to ask.   Below I have put together a chart of the major expenses you will incur before planning your vacation at the Sandals resort.  The good thing is that it's not that expensive at all, and here's why. For decades the Jamaican dollar has been in decline.  This makes it difficult for ordinary citizens to attain a decent standard of living.  While this puts visitors at an advantage, for the most part, locals are left struggling to make ends meet.  Just wanted to run this by you without sounding or becoming too political.  So, without further ado here's a list of the costs involved should you decide to take a Jamaican vacation at the Sandals Resort </p>  
    <ol>
       <li>All inclusive 2 weeks stay for a family of 4...$950</li>
        <li>One time vaction club fee...$250 </li>
        <li>Total costs $1,200</li>
     </ol>
     <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all the details about vacationing at the Sandals Resort, it's time to book that early flight, at least 2 months ahead, because you'll save money and earn valuable points frequent flyer miles.  You and your family will have the adventure of a lifetime, and will be very happy that you made the choice. </p>
